# Introduction #

Like any other python package, install with "python setup.py install" (use sudo to install in main site-package)


# Details #

Instalation process is made using python distutil package, basically it's a very simple python script that installs the code in your python's site-package folder and a script that runs the main method.

So, if still wondering how, here's a simple step by step guide:
  * Download the latest build from [the download page](http://code.google.com/p/pyreaper/downloads/list)
  * Untar with `tar xfvz pyreaper.tar.gz`
  * Go into the folder `cd pyreaper`
  * Install the project `sudo python setup.py install`
  * Test by typing `reaper`
